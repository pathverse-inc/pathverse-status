# Active Context: Pathverse Status Page

## Current Work Focus
**Task**: Component modularization  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - UI components extracted and refactored  
**Last Change**: Created reusable IssueAlert and ServiceChart components

## Recent Changes (Current Session)

### 5. Component Modularization (Latest)
**Problem**: Main page.tsx had duplicated logic for issues and complex chart rendering (~200 lines)  
**Solution**: Extracted into modular components in `app/coms/` directory
- **IssueAlert.tsx**: Reusable component for displaying issues
  - Handles all three issue types (error, warning, info)
  - Consistent styling and icon display
  - Used for both top and bottom issue sections
- **ServiceChart.tsx**: Complete chart component with graph rendering
  - SVG line graph with plotted points
  - Status badge calculation (Up/Down/Degraded)
  - Time-based x-axis labels (30-minute intervals)
  - Y-axis scale (0-100)
  - Color-coded based on status

**Result**: 
- page.tsx reduced from ~200 lines to ~60 lines
- Zero code duplication
- Easier to maintain and test
- Fully type-safe with TypeScript props
- Same visual output and functionality

## Previous Changes (Earlier in Session)

### 1. Health Updater Workflow Refactoring
**Problem**: Cannot use matrix strategy or `uses:` inside steps for reusable workflows  
**Solution**: 
- Created separate jobs for each reusable workflow call
- Changed from single `collect-health-data` job to 4 parallel jobs:
  - `api-health-check` → calls api-health-check.yml
  - `api-degradation` → calls compute-degradation.yml with project_api
  - `webapp-health-check` → calls webapp-health-check.yml
  - `webapp-degradation` → calls compute-degradation.yml with project_webapp

### 2. Output Handling Simplification
**Old Approach**: Tried to package outputs into JSON in intermediate job  
**New Approach**: Access outputs directly from each reusable workflow job
```javascript
// Now we directly reference:
needs.api-health-check.outputs.status
needs.api-degradation.outputs.open_ids
needs.webapp-degradation.outputs.degradation_score
```

### 3. Deploy Job Integration
**Added**: Final deploy job that calls create-deploy-pr.yml  
**Configuration**: Set `approve: false` for manual PR review  
**Flow**: After status files are updated and committed, automatically creates PR to deploy branch

### 4. Status Calculation Logic
**Implemented**: Formula in `update-status-files` job
```javascript
const apiStatus = apiHealth === 0 ? 0 : 100 - apiData.score;
const webappStatus = webappHealth === 0 ? 0 : 100 - webappData.score;

// Update arrays: shift first, push last
status.api.shift();
status.api.push(apiStatus);
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing Phase)
1. **Test health-updater workflow**
   - Manually trigger via workflow_dispatch
   - Verify all 4 health/degradation jobs run successfully
   - Check that status.json and issues.json are updated correctly
   - Confirm deploy PR is created

2. **Validate issue type detection**
   - Currently defaults to `type: 'error'` for all issues
   - Should extract from labels (issue_error/issue_warning/issue_info)
   - Update in future iteration if needed

3. **Monitor cron execution**
   - First automated run at next 30-minute mark
   - Check logs for any failures
   - Verify no git conflicts from parallel operations (shouldn't happen with current sequential structure)

### Future Enhancements
- Add issue type detection from labels instead of defaulting to 'error'
- Consider adding retry logic for health checks
- Add notification system for critical failures
- Implement status history beyond 5 points (if needed)

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Decision: No Matrix Strategy
**Context**: GitHub Actions doesn't support matrix with reusable workflow calls  
**Impact**: More verbose YAML but clearer execution flow  
**Benefit**: Each service's health check and degradation is an independent job, easier to debug

### Decision: Sequential Update Job
**Context**: Single job updates both status.json and issues.json  
**Rationale**: Prevents git conflicts, atomic updates  
**Alternative Considered**: Parallel API/Webapp updates (rejected due to merge conflicts)

### Decision: Auto-approve = false
**Context**: Deploy PR creation with approve input  
**Current Setting**: Manual approval required  
**Rationale**: Allows review before deployment, safer for production  
**Can Change**: Set to `true` if full automation desired

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Workflow Error Resolution Pattern
When encountering GitHub Actions errors:
1. Check if trying to use `uses:` inside steps (must be at job level)
2. Verify output names match exactly between jobs
3. Ensure proper permissions for each job
4. Test context interpolation syntax (arrays vs strings)

### Code Simplification Preference
User prefers:
- Eliminating redundant code
- Reusable components/workflows
- Clear, maintainable structure
- Asking before making assumptions about file organization
- Modular architecture with single responsibility

### Component Design Pattern
When creating components:
- Extract duplicated UI logic
- Keep components focused (one clear purpose)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Maintain consistent styling patterns
- Preserve exact functionality during refactoring

### File Organization Rules (from instructions)
- Ask first if placement unclear
- Minimal implementation only
- One responsibility per file
- No assumptions about structure
- Don't create helpers unless requested

## Learnings & Project Insights

### GitHub Actions Reusable Workflows
**Learning**: `uses:` can only be used at the job level, not in steps  
**Impact**: Required complete restructure of health-updater.yml  
**Best Practice**: Design workflows to be called as complete jobs from the start

### JSON Data Interpolation
**Learning**: GitHub Actions outputs can be interpolated directly without JSON.parse when arrays/objects  
**Example**: `${{ needs.job.outputs.array }}` works directly in JavaScript contexts  
**Caveat**: Need backticks for template literals to properly interpolate

### Issue Boundary Markers
**Learning**: HTML comments are perfect for boundary markers  
**Reason**: Users can't accidentally break parsing, invisible in rendered view  
**Implementation**: Place OUTSIDE user-editable content so degradation score is included in extraction

### Rolling Array Pattern
**Learning**: Simple shift/push maintains fixed-size history  
**Alternative Considered**: Database with unlimited history (rejected - unnecessary complexity)  
**Benefit**: No storage growth, predictable memory usage, fast operations

### Health Check Success Codes
**API**: 401 = Healthy (authentication required is expected)  
**Webapp**: 200 = Healthy (standard success)  
**Insight**: "Success" depends on service expectations, not just 2xx codes

### React Component Extraction
**Learning**: Complex inline logic should be extracted to components when:
- Logic is duplicated (issues rendered twice)
- Component is self-contained (chart with all its calculations)
- Improves readability and maintainability
**Benefit**: Easier testing, clearer separation of concerns, reduced cognitive load

### TypeScript Props Pattern
**Learning**: Component props should mirror the data they render
**Example**: ServiceChart receives `serviceName` and `uptimeData` directly
**Benefit**: Type safety catches errors early, clear component API
